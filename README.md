# BitBot

BitBot is aimed to be an automated bot that can trade Crpyto Currencies on GDAX based off moving averages.

Currently, the concept of buy/selling crpyto currencies based off 10 minute EMA's and 15 minute SMA's has been proven non profitable. The gains from trading are not enough to account for taker fees. Also the time taken for a purchased coin to appear in a wallet is unaccounted for. 

However, it's my hope to test and implement more trading analysis features to make this bot profitable in the futur :).
